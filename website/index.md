## Course Overview

The objective of this course is to provide an overview of empirical research in finance. This course is divided into two main parts. In the first part students develop fundamental programming knowledge and data science skills in the Julia programming language. This part of the course is an intensive introduction to procedures for collecting, processing, and analyzing financial datasets which become increasingly important with the emergence and popularization of "big data" in finance. The second part of the course covers widely-used state-of-the-art statistical methodologies in empirical asset pricing. Students will learn to apply programming techniques to real-world empirical research questions in the equity markets and fixed income markets.

## Learning Goals

After completing this course, students will have a thorough understanding of fundamental programming concepts and tools in financial data science, and be able to apply these skills to real-world problems in empirical asset pricing.
