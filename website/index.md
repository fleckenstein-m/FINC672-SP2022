    1. Download the latest [stable `julia` release](https://julialang.org/downloads/) for your OS.
    1. Download the [`VSCode Editor`](https://code.visualstudio.com)

### Getting Programming Skills

1. Check out [Clement Mazet's materials](https://cms27.github.io/teaching/). You must know this level.

1. Clement in his course will introduce you to things like the [Unix Shell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_shell) and the verion control system Git. Both of those are very useful - for this course, and for the rest of your life as a scientist. 
1. [What is Version Control? watch this 5 minute video.](http://git-scm.com/video/what-is-version-control) and go back to Clement's stuff if unclear.
